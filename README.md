# LearningConceputalDimensions

The code in this repository is used to explore whether deep represenation learning is able to learn interpretable dimensions for the domain of shapes.

Currently, the code requires the following libraries to be installed:
* numpy
* scipy

The code runs under Python 2.7.

In order to create the rectangles data, please execute the following command from the project root directory:
```
python create_data/create_rectangles.py 10000 data/rectancles.pickle
```
